## Contribute

We accept any contributions, big or small. Before submitting a PR it's recommended that you communicate with the developers first (in [issues](https://github.com/friction2d/friction/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/friction2d/friction/discussions)).

It's always preferred to submit PR's against the `main` branch.

## Branches and versions

Friction uses `X.Y.Z` version numbers and `vX.Y` branches.

* `X` = Major
* `Y` = Minor
* `Z` = Patch

Branch `main` is always the current branch for the next `X` or `Y` release.

A new stable branch is cut from `main` on each `X` or `Y` release and is maintained until a new stable branch is created. Patch (`Z`) releases comes from the parent stable branch (`vX.Y`).

Important fixes added to `main` will be backported to active stable branches when possible (and within reason).

Binary SDK available [here](https://github.com/friction2d/friction-sdk/releases).

### Get

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/friction2d/friction
```

Or download a release tarball *(friction-VERSION.tar.bz2)*.

### Build on Linux

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
..
```
Note that on some configurations you may need to specify `qscintilla` paths:
```
-DQSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIRS=<PATH_TO_QSCINTILLA_INCLUDE_DIR> \
-DQSCINTILLA_LIBRARIES_DIRS=<PATH_TO_LIBS> \
-DQSCINTILLA_LIBRARIES=<QSCINTILLA_LIBRARY_NAME> \
```

Now build:

```
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Build on Windows

All requirements must be installed in the correct folders, this is an example and should be adjusted to fit your environment.

```
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat"

set SDK_DIR=%cd%\sdk
set PATH=C:\Python;%ProgramFiles%\CMake\bin;%ProgramFiles%\Git\bin;%SDK_DIR%\bin;%PATH%

mkdir build
cd build

cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%SDK_DIR% ..

cmake --build . --config Release
```
